# BitX40-RaduinoExtra

An enhancement to Asshar Farhan's Raduino software for the BitX40 transceiver. These are the main differences :-

1. Added support for straight key CW based on mod by Don Cantrell ND6Y (http://bitxhacks.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/putting-bitx-raduino-on-cw.html)

2. Added support for 'graphical' S-meter based on mod by Don Cantrell (http://bitxhacks.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/a-simple-s-meter-for-bitx-40-from-don.html) 

This is very much a work in progress and many features are currently untested. The code is built using interrupts to avoid the problems of having delays in the main loop().
